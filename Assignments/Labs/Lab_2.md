### Lab: Experimental Pong - Inspired by Pippin Barr's PONGS
Create a unique variation of Pong that subverts or reimagines one core element of the classic game. Your version should make players think differently about an aspect of Pong that they take for granted.

Feel free to use [Pong](../../Modules/2D/pong) as a reference.

#### Requirements:
- Must be recognizable as a variation of Pong
- Must meaningfully change one core element (ball behavior, paddle function, scoring, screen space, time, etc.)
- Must remain playable (even if deliberately frustrating)

#### Specific Deliverables:
- **Core Mechanics:**
  - Basic Pong elements (ball, paddle(s), play space)
  - One significant twist on traditional Pong mechanics
  - Clear way to start/restart the game
- **Documentation:**
  - README.md explaining your concept
  - Brief artist statement about your design choices
  - Description of how your version subverts expectations

#### Grading Criteria: (Total 6 Points)
- **Concept (0-2):** Does your variation offer an interesting perspective on Pong? Is the twist meaningful rather than random?
- **Implementation (0-2):** Are the basic Pong mechanics functional? Does your twist work as intended?
- **Playability (0-1):** Can players understand and engage with your variation, even if it's intentionally challenging?
- **Documentation (0-1):** Is your concept clearly explained? Does your README articulate the artistic intent?

#### Examples of Possible Variations:
- Time manipulation (slow motion, rewind, freeze)
- Spatial distortion (curved space, wrapping, rotating play field)
- Rule changes (multiple balls, changing paddle functions, scoring inversions)
- Emotional elements (narrative, sound design, visual metaphor)

#### Submission:
Submit your GitHub repository link containing the complete project on Blackboard.

Remember: The goal isn't just to make Pong "different" - it's to use your variation to comment on or explore an aspect of the original game in a thoughtful way.
