# Lab 1: MDA Implementation
**Theory Lens**: Mechanics → Dynamics → Aesthetics Framework  
**Due**: Week 5 (9/30)  
**Points**: 5

## Overview
Create a digital prototype in Godot that intentionally demonstrates the MDA framework - where specific mechanics create intended dynamics that produce a targeted aesthetic experience.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply MDA framework to digital game design
- Understand how code choices affect player experience  
- Document the connection between technical implementation and aesthetic goals
- Practice fundamental Godot concepts through theoretical lens

## Requirements

### Core Implementation
- **One Core Mechanic**: Choose a single, clear game mechanic (movement, collection, timing, etc.)
- **Intentional Dynamics**: Design how this mechanic creates interesting player behavior
- **Clear Aesthetic Goal**: Target specific player emotions or experiences (tension, flow, discovery, etc.)

### Technical Requirements (Godot)
- Main scene with player-controlled element
- At least one script demonstrating the core mechanic
- Basic user input and feedback systems
- Clean, organized project structure

### Documentation Requirements
- **MDA Analysis Document** (500-750 words):
  - **Mechanics**: Describe your implemented mechanic precisely
  - **Dynamics**: Explain what player behaviors/interactions emerge 
  - **Aesthetics**: Define the emotional experience you're targeting
  - **Implementation Reflection**: How do your code choices support the aesthetic goal?
  - **Iteration Notes**: What did you change based on testing?

## Grading Criteria (5 Points Total)

**Mechanic Implementation (2 points)**
- 2: Mechanic is clearly implemented and functions as intended
- 1: Mechanic functions but has minor issues or unclear implementation
- 0: Mechanic is not functional or poorly implemented

**MDA Framework Application (2 points)**
- 2: Clear, thoughtful connection between mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics with evidence of iteration
- 1: Basic understanding of MDA with some connections made
- 0: Little evidence of MDA framework understanding or application

**Documentation Quality (1 point)**
- 1: Complete, well-written analysis that demonstrates understanding
- 0.5: Adequate documentation with some missing elements
- 0: Incomplete or poorly written documentation

## Example Concepts
- **Precision Platforming**: Tight controls (mechanic) → careful movement planning (dynamics) → satisfaction of mastery (aesthetic)
- **Resource Collection**: Limited inventory (mechanic) → strategic decision-making (dynamics) → tension and planning (aesthetic)
- **Rhythm Interaction**: Timed input (mechanic) → pattern recognition (dynamics) → flow state (aesthetic)

## Submission Requirements
- GitHub repository with complete Godot project
- MDA Analysis document in repository README or separate file
- Repository link submitted via course management system

## Tips for Success
- Start simple - focus on one mechanic done well
- Playtest with others and observe their behavior
- Don't just describe what you built - analyze how it affects players
- Consider how small code changes (speed, timing, feedback) impact the experience

*This assignment applies the MDA framework reading to hands-on digital prototyping, establishing the theoretical foundation for all subsequent game development work.*
