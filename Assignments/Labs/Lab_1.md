Lab: Scenes and Scripts in Godot
Create a 2D Godot project that demonstrates basic scene composition and scripting fundamentals.
Requirements:

A main scene with multiple scene instances
Basic scripting implementation with user interaction
Project hosted on GitHub with documentation

Specific Deliverables:

Scene Structure:

Main scene as the project entry point
At least 2 different sprites/images
Multiple instances of a subscene (like trees in a forest)


Scripting Elements:

At least one node with an attached script
Script must include an exported variable
Implementation of conditional logic
Response to user input (keyboard/mouse)


Documentation:

README.md describing your project
Notes on what you learned
Any questions that came up during development



Grading Criteria: (Total 6 Points)

- Scene Implementation (0-2): Does the project include a main scene with at least 2 different sprites and multiple instances of a subscene?
- Script Implementation (0-2): Does the project include a script with an exported variable and conditional logic?
- User Interaction (0-1): Does the project properly respond to user input?
- Project Structure (0-1): Is the project properly organized on GitHub with documentation?

Submission:
Submit your GitHub repository link containing the complete project on Blackboard.
This combines both labs' core concepts while maintaining a total of 6 points, streamlining the requirements while preserving the key learning objectives from both original assignments.
