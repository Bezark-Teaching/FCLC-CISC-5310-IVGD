# Lab 1: Godot Foundations
**Technical Focus**: Essential 2D Godot Skills & Project Structure  
**Due**: Week 5 (9/30)  
**Points**: 7

## Overview
Build a solid foundation in Godot 2D development by creating a simple interactive project that demonstrates core game development concepts including player control, scene management, and basic game mechanics.

## Learning Objectives
- Master fundamental Godot 2D concepts (scenes, nodes, scripts)
- Implement basic player character control in 2D
- Create simple interactive elements that respond to player actions
- Practice clean code organization and project structure
- Build technical foundation for more complex projects

## Requirements

### Player Character
- A controllable player character using any movement method (CharacterBody2D, RigidBody2D, or direct transform manipulation)
- Smooth, responsive controls that feel good to use

### Interactive Element
- At least one object the player can interact with (collectible, door, switch, enemy, etc.)
- Clear visual or audio feedback when interaction occurs
- Interaction can be collision-based, input-based, or proximity-based

### Basic Project Organization
- Well-organized main scene with logical node hierarchy
- Clean file structure and meaningful node names
- Basic commenting in scripts

### Submission Requirements
- GitHub repository with complete Godot project
- Repository link submitted via course management system

## Grading Criteria (7 Points Total)

**Player Character Implementation (3 points)**
- 3: Smooth, responsive movement that feels polished
- 2: Good player movement with minor issues
- 1: Basic functional movement
- 0: Non-functional or very poor movement

**Interactive Element (2 points)**
- 2: Clear, satisfying interaction with appropriate feedback
- 1: Basic interaction that works but limited feedback
- 0: Poor or non-functional interaction

**Code Quality & Project Organization (2 points)**
- 2: Clean, well-commented code with logical project organization
- 1: Functional code with basic organization
- 0: Poor code organization or minimal commenting

## Example Projects
- **Simple Collector**: Player moves around collecting coins or items that disappear when touched
- **Basic Platformer**: Player character that can jump and collect items or hit switches
- **Top-Down Explorer**: Overhead view where player can walk through doors or pick up objects
- **Reaction Game**: Player clicks or moves to interact with objects that respond

## Tips for Success
- **Start with Movement**: Get player character working first, then add one simple interaction
- **Keep It Simple**: Focus on making one interaction feel good rather than many complex ones
- **Test Frequently**: Run your project often to catch issues early
- **Organize Early**: Set up clean project structure from the beginning
- **Comment Your Code**: Explain what your scripts do for future reference
- **Reference Documentation**: Use Godot's excellent documentation when stuck

*This assignment establishes essential Godot skills that will be foundation for all subsequent projects, from emergence simulations to environmental storytelling.*
