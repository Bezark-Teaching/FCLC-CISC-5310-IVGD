# Walking Sim Project
**Theory Lens**: Environmental Storytelling & Spatial Affordances  
**Assigned**: Week 9 (10/28) | **Due**: Week 12 (11/18)  
**Points**: 15

## Overview
Create a 3D walking simulator that tells a story purely through environmental design, spatial composition, and atmospheric elements. This project applies Gibson's affordance theory and Jenkins' narrative architecture concepts to create meaningful spatial experiences.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply affordance theory to communicate narrative without explicit text/UI
- Understand environmental storytelling as a sophisticated design practice
- Master 3D atmosphere creation through lighting, audio, and composition
- Create immersive experiences through spatial design alone

## Requirements

### Environmental Storytelling Focus
- **No Text/Dialogue**: Story must be told entirely through environmental design
- **Spatial Narrative**: Use architectural composition, object placement, and environmental cues
- **Emotional Journey**: Design a clear emotional arc through spatial experience
- **Player Discovery**: Allow players to piece together narrative through exploration

### Technical Requirements (Godot 4)
- **First-Person Movement**: Smooth, intuitive CharacterBody3D controller
- **3D Environment**: Carefully composed spaces using meshes, CSG, or imported models  
- **Atmospheric Systems**: Lighting design, particle effects, spatial audio implementation
- **Performance Optimization**: Proper LOD, occlusion culling, or scene organization

### Duration & Scope
- **15-20 minute experience**: Focused, complete narrative arc
- **Single path recommended**: Guide player through intentional spatial sequence
- **Environmental interaction**: Minimal but meaningful (doors, lights, simple triggers)

## Grading Criteria (15 Points Total)

**Environmental Storytelling (6 points)**
- 6: Sophisticated narrative told entirely through spatial design with clear emotional impact
- 5: Strong environmental narrative with mostly effective spatial storytelling
- 4: Good use of environmental elements to suggest narrative
- 3: Basic environmental storytelling with some effective moments
- 2: Attempted environmental narrative but unclear or weak
- 1: Minimal environmental storytelling elements
- 0: No clear environmental narrative

**Spatial Design & Affordances (4 points)**
- 4: Excellent spatial composition where form clearly suggests function and guides player movement
- 3: Good spatial design with clear affordances and effective player guidance
- 2: Adequate spatial design with some effective affordances
- 1: Basic spatial design with minimal clear affordances
- 0: Poor spatial design that confuses player movement or interaction

**Atmospheric Implementation (3 points)**
- 3: Professional-quality atmosphere through lighting, audio, and environmental effects
- 2: Good atmospheric elements that enhance the experience
- 1: Basic atmospheric elements present but could be stronger
- 0: Minimal or ineffective atmospheric design

**Technical Implementation (2 points)**
- 2: Smooth performance, intuitive controls, well-optimized 3D environment
- 1: Functional implementation with minor technical issues
- 0: Significant technical problems that interfere with experience

## Documentation Requirements
**Environmental Design Analysis** (750-1000 words):
- **Spatial Narrative Strategy**: How did you use space to tell your story?
- **Affordance Implementation**: Specific examples of how environment communicates interaction
- **Atmospheric Choices**: How did lighting, audio, and effects support your narrative?
- **Player Journey**: Describe the intended emotional arc and how space creates it
- **Design Challenges**: What spatial storytelling problems did you solve?

## Theoretical Framework Application
- **Gibson's Affordances**: How does your environment suggest actions without UI?
- **Jenkins' Narrative Architecture**: How does space function as storytelling medium?
- **Spatial Composition**: Use of architectural principles for emotional impact
- **Environmental Psychology**: How does space affect player emotional state?

## Example Approaches
- **Memory/Nostalgia**: Childhood home that reveals family history through spatial changes
- **Isolation/Connection**: Journey from confined to open spaces reflecting emotional state
- **Time/Decay**: Environment showing passage of time through visual environmental cues
- **Mystery/Discovery**: Spaces that gradually reveal their purpose through exploration

## Technical Focus Areas
- **Lighting Design**: Use of light to guide attention and create mood
- **Spatial Audio**: 3D positioned sound that enhances environmental storytelling
- **Environmental Details**: Small elements that add narrative depth without explicit explanation
- **Player Movement Flow**: Designing spaces that naturally guide exploration

## Submission Requirements
- GitHub repository with complete Godot 3D project
- Environmental Design Analysis document in repository
- Repository link submitted via course management system

## Tips for Success
- **Study Real Architecture**: How do real spaces make you feel and guide your movement?
- **Start with Emotion**: What feeling do you want players to experience?
- **Prototype Early**: Test movement and spatial flow before adding narrative details
- **Show, Don't Tell**: Resist the urge to explain - let the environment speak
- **Playtesting is Key**: Watch others play without guidance to see if your spatial story works

*This assignment explores environmental storytelling as a sophisticated graduate-level design practice, applying spatial theory to create meaningful narrative experiences.*
