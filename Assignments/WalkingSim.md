### Assignment Prompt: 3D Walking Simulator Individual Project in Godot 4

#### Objective:
Design and create a 3D walking simulator using Godot 4 that delivers a compelling narrative or emotional experience within a 15-20 minute timeframe. Your game should focus on environmental storytelling and create an immersive atmosphere for players.

#### Constraints:
- **Game Environment:** The game must be a single-player first-person experience developed using Godot 4's 3D features
- **Duration:** The game's total playtime should not exceed 20 minutes, ensuring a focused exploratory experience
- **Clear Objective:** The game must guide players through its narrative using environmental storytelling and atmospheric elements
- **Rule-set:** Incorporate simple yet effective movement and interaction mechanics that feel natural and intuitive

#### Submission Requirements:
- **3D Game Prototype** - Submit a digital version of your 3D walking simulator developed in Godot 4

#### Grading Criteria: (Total 16 Points)
- **Meeting stated design goals (0-4):** Does the game have a clear narrative direction, consistent atmosphere, meaningful progression, and emotional impact?
- **Tutorial (0-4):** Does the game naturally teach players its movement and interaction mechanics? When conducting in class playtests, you will not be allowed to explain how to play the game, so ensure players can intuitively learn through environmental cues and optional prompts
- **Technical Implementation (0-4):** The project should demonstrate proper use of CharacterBody3D, lighting systems, and 3D audio. This will be evaluated through code review and performance testing
- **Polish (0-4):** Special attention should be paid to atmospheric elements like particle effects, post-processing, ambient sound, and environmental details

#### Tips for Success:
- **Begin with Basics:** Start with a working first-person controller and basic environment blockout before adding narrative elements
- **Iterative Design:** Use playtesting feedback to refine movement feel and environmental navigation
- **Utilize Godot Resources:** Take advantage of Godot 4's documentation, especially regarding 3D features and optimization
- **Performance First:** Build with performance in mind from the start, using tools like OccluderInstance3D and proper scene organization
