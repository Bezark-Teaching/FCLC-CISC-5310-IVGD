# Capstone Technical Presentation
**Professional Practice**: Industry-Style Technical Architecture Presentation  
**Due**: Week 13 (11/25) - Thanksgiving Week  
**Points**: 10

## Overview
Present your capstone project's technical architecture and design philosophy to the class in a professional-style presentation. This simulates industry practice where developers present technical decisions to stakeholders and peers for feedback before final implementation.

## Learning Objectives
- Practice professional technical communication skills
- Receive peer feedback on architectural and design decisions before final development
- Demonstrate mastery of course theoretical frameworks in project context
- Build confidence presenting complex technical concepts to audiences

## Presentation Requirements

### Duration & Format
- **10-minute Presentation**: Strict time limit (industry standard for technical reviews)
- **Professional Delivery**: Use industry-standard presentation practices
- **Technical Focus**: Emphasize architecture, patterns, and theoretical framework application
- **Visual Support**: Slides, diagrams, code examples, or prototype demonstrations

### Required Content Areas

#### 1. Project Technical Architecture (3 minutes)
- **Design Pattern Implementation**: Which patterns are you using and why?
- **System Architecture**: How is your project organized and structured?
- **Technology Decisions**: Key Godot features, tools, and technical approaches
- **Code Organization**: How you're maintaining clean, professional code structure

#### 2. Theoretical Framework Integration (4 minutes)
- **Systems Thinking Application**: How does your project demonstrate systems design?
- **Design Pattern Usage**: Specific examples of pattern implementation in your code
- **Spatial Design Considerations**: If applicable, how space serves your design goals
- **Professional Practice Elements**: Development process, documentation, testing approaches

#### 3. Development Process & Risk Management (2 minutes)
- **Current Development Status**: What's complete, in progress, and planned
- **Technical Challenges**: Problems encountered and solutions implemented or planned
- **Timeline & Scope Management**: How you're managing remaining development time
- **Contingency Planning**: Backup plans if technical challenges arise

#### 4. Seeking Feedback (1 minute)
- **Specific Questions**: What technical/design decisions would you like feedback on?
- **Areas of Concern**: Where would peer input be most valuable?
- **Implementation Alternatives**: Are you considering different approaches to key problems?

## Grading Criteria (10 Points Total)

**Technical Communication (4 points)**
- 4: Excellent technical communication with clear explanations suitable for technical audience
- 3: Good technical communication with mostly clear explanations
- 2: Adequate technical communication with some unclear areas
- 1: Poor technical communication or confusing explanations
- 0: Inadequate or missing technical content

**Course Framework Integration (3 points)**
- 3: Clear, sophisticated application of multiple course frameworks with specific examples
- 2: Good application of course frameworks with adequate examples
- 1: Basic application of some course frameworks
- 0: Little or no evidence of course framework integration

**Professional Presentation Skills (2 points)**
- 2: Professional presentation delivery, effective use of time, engaging visual aids
- 1: Good presentation skills with minor areas for improvement
- 0: Poor presentation skills or ineffective delivery

**Constructive Engagement (1 point)**
- 1: Thoughtful questions for audience, receptive to feedback, facilitates productive discussion
- 0.5: Some engagement but could be more thoughtful or receptive
- 0: Poor engagement or defensive response to feedback

## Presentation Tips

### Technical Communication Best Practices
- **Lead with the Big Picture**: Start with overall architecture before diving into details
- **Use Visual Aids Effectively**: Code snippets, diagrams, and architectural drawings
- **Explain the "Why"**: Don't just describe what you're doing, explain your reasoning
- **Connect to Theory**: Explicitly link technical decisions to course concepts

### Professional Development Focus
- **Industry Simulation**: Treat this as practice for technical reviews in professional settings
- **Peer Learning**: Learn from others' technical approaches and decisions
- **Feedback Integration**: Use feedback to improve your final implementation
- **Portfolio Building**: Practice articulating technical decisions for future job interviews

### Content Strategy
- **Be Specific**: Use concrete examples rather than general descriptions
- **Show Code**: Brief, relevant code examples are more valuable than abstract explanations
- **Acknowledge Uncertainty**: It's professional to identify areas where you're still making decisions
- **Focus on Impact**: How do your technical decisions affect the player experience?

## Submission Requirements
- Professional presentation delivered in class
- Presentation materials (slides, diagrams, etc.) submitted digitally
- Thoughtful participation in peer Q&A sessions
- Brief reflection on feedback received and how it will influence final development

## Follow-up Expectations
After presentations, you should:
- Incorporate valuable feedback into your final development phase
- Document how peer input influenced your final technical decisions
- Reference this presentation in your final project documentation

*This presentation prepares you for professional technical communication while providing valuable peer feedback for your capstone project's final development phase.*
