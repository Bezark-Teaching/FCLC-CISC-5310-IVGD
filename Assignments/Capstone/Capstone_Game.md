# Capstone Game Project
**Synthesis**: Demonstrating Mastery of Systems Thinking and Game Development
**Assigned**: Week 9 (10/28) | **Due**: Week 15 (12/9)
**Points**: 40

## Overview
Create a sophisticated game that demonstrates mastery of systems thinking, emergent design, and professional game development practices. This can be an evolution/expansion of any previous assignment (Tabletop, 2D Game, or Walking Sim) or an entirely new project. **If building on a previous assignment, the capstone grade can replace the original assignment's grade if higher.**

## Learning Objectives
- Synthesize systems thinking, emergent design, and spatial considerations in a single polished project
- Create a complete, professional-quality game experience that reflects graduate-level sophistication
- Present and defend your design and technical decisions to peers and instructor
- Demonstrate mastery of practical game development skills

## Requirements

### Project Scope & Collaboration
- **Individual or Group Work**: Self-selected teams up to 3 people (individual projects encouraged for portfolio development)
- **15-25 Minute Experience**: Complete, polished game with clear beginning, middle, and end
- **Platform Choice**: Any combination of 2D/3D in Godot 4.x that best serves your design vision
- **Distribution Ready**: Exported and published on itch.io for public access

### Graduate-Level Expectations
- **Systems Thinking Application**: Demonstrate interconnected game systems and emergent gameplay
- **Professional Technical Implementation**: Sophisticated understanding of Godot and game architecture
- **Player Experience Focus**: Game teaches itself and provides engaging, meaningful interactions
- **Innovation & Polish**: Show creative application of course concepts with professional-level execution

- 8: Good system implementation with some emergent behaviors and adequate systems thinking
- 5: Basic system design with minimal emergence or limited systems thinking application
- 2: Poor system design with little evidence of emergent gameplay or systems thinking
- 0: No clear system design or systems thinking application

**Technical Sophistication & Code Quality (12 points)**
- 12: Professional-level technical implementation with excellent code organization, architecture, and innovative problem-solving
- 9: Strong technical implementation with good code quality and solid architecture
- 6: Adequate technical implementation meeting project requirements with decent code organization
- 3: Basic technical implementation with some code quality issues
- 1: Limited technical implementation or significant functionality problems
- 0: Poor technical implementation or non-functional project

**Player Experience & Game Polish (9 points)**
- 9: Exceptional player experience - game teaches itself perfectly, engaging throughout, with professional-level polish
- 7: Strong player experience with good self-teaching game design and solid polish
- 5: Good player experience that mostly teaches itself with adequate polish
- 3: Basic player experience with some confusion or limited polish
- 1: Poor player experience or minimal polish
- 0: Confusing player experience or no polish

**Professional Presentation & Process (5 points)**
- 5: Excellent presentation demonstrating clear development process, articulate design defense, and portfolio-ready work
- 4: Good presentation with solid development process and adequate design articulation
- 3: Adequate presentation meeting requirements with basic development process shown
- 2: Basic presentation with limited development process evidence
- 1: Poor presentation or minimal development process
- 0: Inadequate presentation or no clear development process

## Submission Requirements

- GitHub repository with complete Godot project and clear README
- Well-commented code demonstrating architecture and system design
- Published game on itch.io for public access
- Brief post-mortem document reflecting on development process and systems design choices

### Final Presentation (Week 15)
- **10-minute Presentation**: Live gameplay demonstration with systems design discussion
- **Q&A Session**: Defend design and technical decisions, discuss systems thinking application
- **Peer Review**: Provide constructive feedback on classmates' projects

## Timeline & Milestones

**Week 9 (Assignment)**: Brief concept discussion in class - what systems will you focus on?
**Week 11**: Mid-development check-in with systems demonstration
**Week 12**: Technical presentation of architecture and player experience
**Week 14**: Final development and polish phase
**Week 15**: Final presentations and peer review

## Tips for Success
- **Think Systems First**: How will your interconnected systems create interesting emergent gameplay?
- **Consider Evolution**: Can you expand your tabletop game digitally? Add complexity to your 2D game? Make your walking sim more interactive?
- **Focus on Player Understanding**: Can players immediately understand your systems through play?
- **Professional Standards**: Treat this as a portfolio piece - quality and polish over raw scope
- **Test Extensively**: Graduate-level games should be thoroughly playtested and iterated
- **Document Your Process**: Keep notes on your systems design decisions for your presentation
- **Plan for Presentation**: Your ability to articulate systems thinking is as important as the game itself

## Systems Thinking Questions for Development
- What are the core systems in your game and how do they interact?
- What emergent behaviors arise from your simple rules?
- How does player agency affect system states and outcomes?
- What feedback loops exist, and are they reinforcing or balancing?
- How does your game teach players about these system relationships?
