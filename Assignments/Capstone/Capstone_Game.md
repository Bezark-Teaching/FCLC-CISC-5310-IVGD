# Capstone Game Project
**Theory Integration**: Synthesizing All Course Frameworks  
**Assigned**: Week 9 (10/28) | **Due**: Week 15 (12/9)  
**Points**: 33

## Overview
Create a sophisticated game that demonstrates mastery of all course theoretical frameworks: systems thinking, design patterns, spatial design, and professional development practices. This capstone project showcases your growth as a graduate-level game developer.

## Learning Objectives
- Synthesize systems thinking, design patterns, and spatial design in a single project
- Demonstrate professional development practices and industry-level documentation
- Create a complete, polished game experience that reflects graduate-level sophistication
- Present and defend your design and technical decisions to peers and instructor

## Requirements

### Project Scope & Collaboration
- **Individual or Group Work**: Self-selected teams up to 3 people (individual projects encouraged for portfolio development)
- **15-20 Minute Experience**: Complete, polished game with clear beginning, middle, and end
- **Platform Choice**: Any combination of 2D/3D in Godot 4.x that best serves your design vision
- **Distribution Ready**: Exported and published on itch.io for public access

### Graduate-Level Expectations
- **Theoretical Framework Integration**: Demonstrate systems thinking, design patterns, spatial considerations, and professional practices
- **Advanced Technical Implementation**: Go beyond basic Godot usage to show sophisticated understanding
- **Professional Documentation**: Industry-standard project documentation, code organization, and presentation
- **Innovation & Risk-Taking**: Show creative application of course concepts in original ways

## Grading Criteria (33 Points Total)

**Theoretical Framework Integration (10 points)**
- 10: Sophisticated synthesis of systems thinking, design patterns, and spatial design with clear evidence of all course frameworks
- 8: Good integration of most course frameworks with clear theoretical application
- 6: Basic integration of some course frameworks with adequate theoretical understanding
- 4: Minimal integration of course frameworks or unclear theoretical application
- 2: Little evidence of course framework integration
- 0: No clear connection to course theoretical content

**Technical Sophistication & Innovation (10 points)**
- 10: Advanced technical implementation showing mastery of Godot and creative problem-solving
- 8: Good technical implementation with some sophisticated elements
- 6: Solid technical implementation meeting project requirements
- 4: Basic technical implementation with minor issues
- 2: Limited technical implementation or significant functionality problems
- 0: Poor technical implementation or non-functional project

**Game Design & Player Experience (8 points)**
- 8: Exceptional game design creating engaging, meaningful player experience with clear design vision
- 7: Strong game design with good player experience and clear objectives
- 6: Good game design meeting project requirements with adequate player experience
- 4: Basic game design with some player experience issues
- 2: Limited game design or confusing player experience
- 0: Poor game design or unclear player experience

**Professional Presentation & Documentation (5 points)**
- 5: Professional-quality presentation, documentation, and project organization suitable for portfolio
- 4: Good presentation and documentation with minor areas for improvement
- 3: Adequate presentation and documentation meeting requirements
- 2: Basic presentation or documentation with significant gaps
- 1: Poor presentation or minimal documentation
- 0: Inadequate presentation or missing documentation

## Submission Requirements

- GitHub repository with complete Godot project
- Well-commented code demonstrating architecture and design patterns
- Repository link submitted via course management system

### Final Presentation (Week 15)
- **10-minute Presentation**: Live gameplay demonstration with technical discussion
- **Q&A Session**: Defend design and technical decisions
- **Peer Review**: Provide constructive feedback on classmates' projects

## Timeline & Milestones

**Week 9 (Assignment)**: Concept proposal with theoretical framework application plan
**Week 11**: Mid-development check-in with progress demonstration  
**Week 13**: Technical presentation of architecture and systems
**Week 14**: Final development and polish phase
**Week 15**: Final presentations and peer review

## Tips for Success
- **Start with Theory**: How will your game demonstrate course frameworks? Plan this before coding
- **Document Throughout**: Keep development diary of technical and design decisions
- **Playtest Extensively**: Graduate-level games should be thoroughly tested and iterated
- **Professional Standards**: Treat this as a portfolio piece - quality over scope
- **Take Creative Risks**: This is your chance to show innovative application of course concepts
- **Plan for Presentation**: Your ability to articulate design decisions is as important as the game itself

## Submission Requirements
- Complete Godot project with professional organization and documentation
- Technical and design documentation (combined 2000-3000 words)
- Published game on itch.io with professional page presentation
- In-class presentation and live playtest session
- Post-mortem reflection integrating all course theoretical frameworks

*This capstone project demonstrates your mastery of graduate-level game design thinking and professional development practices, serving as a portfolio piece for your future career development.*
