# 2D Game Project

## Overview
Design and create a complete 2D game using Godot 4.5 that can be played and completed within a 10-15 minute timeframe. Your game should demonstrate the systems thinking and emergent design principles we've been exploring, while creating an engaging player experience.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply systems thinking concepts to create interesting game dynamics
- Build interconnected game systems that communicate effectively
- Create intuitive player feedback that teaches the game without explanation
- Experience complete game development from concept to polished product

## Requirements

### Game Specifications
- **Platform**: Godot 4.5 2D project
- **Duration**: 10-15 minute complete play experience
- **Scope**: Single-player recommended (local multiplayer acceptable)
- **Completion**: Must have clear objective, win/lose conditions, and proper ending

### Systems Focus
- **Interconnected Systems**: Build game systems that affect each other (like health, score, difficulty, progression)
- **Emergent Gameplay**: Simple rules that create interesting, varied player experiences
- **System Feedback**: Players should understand how systems work through visual/audio cues
- **Player Agency**: Meaningful choices that affect system states and outcomes

## Grading Criteria (25 Points Total)

**Game Design & Systems (10 points)**
- 10: Excellent use of interconnected systems creating emergent, engaging gameplay
- 7: Good system design with clear interactions and player feedback
- 5: Basic system implementation with some interconnection
- 2: Minimal system thinking applied to game design
- 0: No clear system design or interconnected gameplay

**Player Experience & Tutorial (10 points)**
- 10: Game teaches itself perfectly - players learn through play without explanation
- 7: Game mostly teaches itself with clear feedback and intuitive design
- 5: Game teaches itself adequately but may need some clarification
- 2: Some tutorial elements present but players may struggle to understand
- 0: Game doesn't teach itself, requires external explanation

**Technical Implementation & Polish (5 points)**
- 5: Robust game that runs smoothly from start to finish with good polish
- 3: Game runs adequately with basic polish and minor technical issues
- 1: Game functions but has noticeable technical problems
- 0: Game has major technical issues preventing completion

## Submission Requirements
- GitHub repository with complete Godot 2D project
- Brief README explaining your system design choices
- Repository link submitted via course management system

## Technical Expectations
- **Robust Error Handling**: Game should run from beginning to end without crashing
- **Intuitive Player Experience**: Game teaches itself without external instruction needed
- **System Clarity**: Players understand cause and effect relationships in your game
- **Smooth Performance**: Game runs smoothly without technical issues

## Tips for Success
- **Start Simple**: Build core systems first, then add complexity
- **Test Early and Often**: Playtest with others to see if your game teaches itself
- **Focus on Feel**: Polish how systems feel to interact with, not just how they look
- **Think Systems**: Ask "how do my game elements affect each other?"
- **Scope Appropriately**: Better to have a simple, polished game than a complex, unfinished one

*This assignment applies the systems thinking concepts from Advanced Game Design to create engaging, well-architected 2D games that demonstrate emergent gameplay principles.*
