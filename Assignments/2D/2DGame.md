# 2D Game Project
**Theory Lens**: Design Patterns & Clean Architecture  
**Assigned**: Week 5 (9/30) | **Due**: Week 9 (10/28)  
**Points**: 34

## Overview
Create a complete 2D game over 4+ weeks that demonstrates clean architecture, design patterns, and professional development practices. This is your first major project applying the theoretical frameworks from the design patterns section.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply design patterns to create maintainable, reusable game architecture
- Experience professional-style background project development over multiple weeks
- Implement clean code practices and separation of concerns
- Create a polished, complete game experience through iterative development

## Requirements

### Game Specifications
- **Platform**: Godot 4.x 2D project
- **Duration**: 10-15 minute complete play experience  
- **Scope**: Single-player recommended (local multiplayer acceptable)
- **Completion**: Must have clear objective, win/lose conditions, and proper ending

### Architecture Requirements (Graduate Level)
- **Design Pattern Implementation**: Demonstrate at least 3 different design patterns from course readings
- **Clean Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns, meaningful naming, reusable components
- **Professional Git Practice**: Regular commits, meaningful commit messages, organized project structure
- **Code Documentation**: Well-commented code explaining architectural decisions

### Development Process Requirements  
- **Week 5 (Assignment)**: Game concept and architectural planning
- **Week 6**: Core mechanics implementation with pattern documentation
- **Week 7**: Individual check-ins on progress and architecture decisions  
- **Week 8**: Polish phase - juice, feedback systems, testing
- **Week 9 (Due)**: Presentation and peer review

## Grading Criteria (34 Points Total)

**Architecture & Design Patterns (11 points)**
- 11: Sophisticated implementation of 3+ design patterns with clear architectural benefits
- 8: Good implementation of 3 design patterns with mostly clean architecture  
- 6: Basic implementation of 2-3 patterns with adequate organization
- 3: Attempted pattern implementation but with architectural issues
- 0: No clear design pattern implementation or poor architecture

**Game Completion & Polish (10 points)**
- 10: Complete, polished experience with excellent juice, audio, and visual feedback
- 8: Complete game with good polish and professional feel
- 6: Functional complete game with basic polish
- 4: Complete but minimal polish or minor functionality issues
- 2: Incomplete game but demonstrates significant progress  
- 0: Minimal progress or non-functional game

**Code Quality & Documentation (8 points)**
- 8: Professional-level code organization, naming, comments, and documentation
- 6: Good code quality with clear organization and adequate documentation
- 4: Functional code with basic organization and some documentation
- 2: Working code but poor organization or minimal documentation
- 0: Code is difficult to follow or poorly organized

**Development Process & Presentation (5 points)**
- 5: Excellent project management, regular commits, strong presentation with architectural discussion
- 4: Good development process with solid presentation
- 3: Adequate development process and presentation
- 2: Basic development process or presentation issues
- 1: Minimal evidence of good development practices
- 0: Poor development process and weak presentation

## Documentation Requirements
**Architecture Document** (1000-1500 words):
- **Design Pattern Implementation**: Detailed explanation of each pattern used and why
- **Architectural Decisions**: Key structural choices and their benefits
- **Development Process Reflection**: How did the 4+ week timeline affect your design approach?
- **Code Organization**: How did you structure your project for maintainability?
- **Post-Mortem**: What would you do differently in future projects?

## Professional Development Focus
- **Background Project Management**: Experience developing a project over multiple weeks while learning new concepts
- **Iterative Development**: Regular check-ins, feedback integration, and scope adjustment
- **Code Review Practice**: Peer review sessions and architectural discussions  
- **Professional Presentation**: Technical presentation skills for project architecture

## Technical Expectations
- **Robust Error Handling**: Game should not crash during normal play
- **Intuitive Player Experience**: Game teaches itself without external instruction
- **Performance Optimization**: Smooth gameplay without technical issues
- **Export & Distribution**: Properly exported for easy playtest sharing

## Tips for Success
- **Start with Architecture**: Plan your patterns and structure before coding
- **Regular Commits**: Use git professionally - small, frequent, meaningful commits
- **Platest Early and Often**: Get feedback on your game experience, not just the code
- **Document as You Go**: Don't wait until the end to write about your architectural decisions
- **Balance Scope with Polish**: Better to have a simple game that's very polished than a complex game that's incomplete

*This assignment simulates professional game development practices while applying design pattern theory to create maintainable, sophisticated 2D games.*
