# Tabletop Game Project
**Theory Lens**: Game Design as Systems Design  
**Assigned**: Week 1 (9/2) | **Due**: Week 3 (9/16)  
**Points**: 14

## Overview
Design and create a tabletop game that demonstrates explicit systems thinking. This analog project establishes the foundation for understanding games as complex adaptive systems before transitioning to digital development.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply systems thinking to game design fundamentals
- Create explicit system diagrams showing inputs, processes, outputs, and feedback loops
- Understand how game mechanics create player dynamics and aesthetic experiences
- Practice iterative design through playtesting and systems analysis

## Requirements

### Game Specifications
- **Classroom Playable**: Must work within classroom space and time constraints
- **15-minute Duration**: Complete play experience within time limit
- **2-4 Players**: Designed for small group classroom play
- **Clear Victory Condition**: Explicit win/lose states with defined objectives

### Systems Analysis Requirements (Graduate Level)
- **Causal Loop Diagram**: A structured systems analysis showing:
  - **Variables**: Key game elements that change during play (e.g., player score, resource levels, turn position)
  - **Causal Links**: Arrows connecting variables with S (Same) or O (Opposite) notation
    - **S notation**: When one variable increases, the linked variable increases
    - **O notation**: When one variable increases, the linked variable decreases
  - **Loop Identification**: At least two distinct feedback loops, each clearly labeled as:
    - **Reinforcing Loop (R)**: Accelerates change in one direction
    - **Balancing Loop (B)**: Seeks equilibrium or limits growth

### Physical Deliverables
- **Game Prototype**: Physical, playable version using available materials
- **Complete Ruleset**: Clear, comprehensive rules that enable independent play
- **Causal Loop Diagram**: Visual diagram with S/O notation and labeled feedback loops

## Grading Criteria (14 Points Total)

**Causal Loop Analysis & Diagram (6 points)**
- 6: Sophisticated causal loop diagram with correct S/O notation, clearly labeled R/B loops, and insightful analysis of system dynamics
- 5: Good causal loop diagram with mostly correct notation and identified loops
- 4: Basic causal loop diagram with some correct notation and at least one clear loop
- 3: Attempted causal loop diagram but missing key elements or incorrect notation
- 2: Minimal systems thinking with unclear or incorrect diagram structure
- 0: No causal loop analysis provided

**Game Functionality & Design (5 points)**  
- 5: Game functions excellently within constraints with clear design goals achieved
- 4: Game works well with minor issues, mostly achieves design goals
- 3: Game is functional and meets basic requirements
- 2: Game works but has functionality issues or unclear goals
- 1: Game has significant problems but demonstrates effort
- 0: Game is non-functional or incomplete

**Rule Clarity & Completeness (3 points)**
- 3: Rules are clear, complete, and enable independent play by others
- 2: Rules are mostly clear with minor gaps or confusion
- 1: Rules are present but have significant clarity issues
- 0: Rules are incomplete or very unclear

## Causal Loop Diagram Requirements
**Structured Causal Loop Analysis**:
- **Variable Selection**: Identify 4-6 key variables that change during gameplay
- **Causal Relationships**: Connect variables with arrows labeled S or O
- **Loop Labeling**: Clearly mark each feedback loop as R (Reinforcing) or B (Balancing)
- **System Behavior**: Brief explanation of how each loop affects gameplay dynamics
- **Design Intention**: How do these loops create the player experience you intended?

## Theoretical Framework Focus
- **Salen & Zimmerman Systems Theory**: Apply systems thinking from your assigned reading
- **Meaningful Choice**: How does your system create interesting player decisions?
- **Emergent vs. Embedded Narrative**: What stories emerge from your system vs. what you designed?
- **System Balance**: How do feedback loops maintain engaging play?

## Example Systems Elements to Consider
- **Resource Management**: Limited components creating scarcity decisions
- **Information Systems**: Hidden/revealed information affecting player choices
- **Interaction Systems**: How players affect each other's game states
- **Random Systems**: Chance elements and their impact on deterministic choices
- **Timing Systems**: Turn order, simultaneous play, or real-time elements

## Submission Requirements
- Physical game prototype brought to class for playtest session
- Complete ruleset (digital document)
- Causal loop diagram with S/O notation and labeled feedback loops (visual/digital)
- In-class presentation of game and systems analysis

## Tips for Success
- **Start with the System**: Think about what kind of player behavior you want to encourage, then design systems that reward that behavior
- **Test Early and Often**: Playtest with others and observe how your system actually functions vs. your intentions
- **Embrace Simplicity**: Complex systems can emerge from simple rules
- **Document as You Design**: Keep track of how your system changes through iteration
- **Focus on Feedback**: How do players know they're making meaningful choices?

## Class Playtest Session Format
- Brief (2-minute) explanation of your game's system design goals
- Guided playtest with classmates (12-15 minutes)
- Group discussion of how the system functioned in practice
- Reflection on systems analysis accuracy

*This assignment establishes systems thinking as the foundation for all subsequent game design work, providing the conceptual framework for understanding games as designed experiences rather than arbitrary collections of rules.*
