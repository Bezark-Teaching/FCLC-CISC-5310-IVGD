# Tabletop Game Project
**Theory Lens**: Game Design as Systems Design  
**Assigned**: Week 1 (9/2) | **Due**: Week 3 (9/16)  
**Points**: 14

## Overview
Design and create a tabletop game that demonstrates explicit systems thinking. This analog project establishes the foundation for understanding games as complex adaptive systems before transitioning to digital development.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply systems thinking to game design fundamentals
- Create explicit system diagrams showing inputs, processes, outputs, and feedback loops
- Understand how game mechanics create player dynamics and aesthetic experiences
- Practice iterative design through playtesting and systems analysis

## Requirements

### Game Specifications
- **Classroom Playable**: Must work within classroom space and time constraints
- **15-minute Duration**: Complete play experience within time limit
- **2-4 Players**: Designed for small group classroom play
- **Clear Victory Condition**: Explicit win/lose states with defined objectives

### Systems Analysis Requirements (Graduate Level)
Choose the most appropriate systems analysis for your game:

**Option A: Causal Loop Diagram** (best for feedback-heavy systems):
  - **Variables**: Key game elements that change during play (e.g., player score, resource levels, turn position)
  - **Causal Links**: Arrows connecting variables with S (Same) or O (Opposite) notation
    - **S notation**: When one variable increases, the linked variable increases
    - **O notation**: When one variable increases, the linked variable decreases
  - **Loop Identification**: At least two distinct feedback loops, each clearly labeled as:
    - **Reinforcing Loop (R)**: Accelerates change in one direction
    - **Balancing Loop (B)**: Seeks equilibrium or limits growth

**Option B: Stock and Flow Diagram** (best for resource/accumulation systems):
  - **Stocks**: Things that can be accumulated (e.g., points, cards, territory, energy)
  - **Flows**: Rates that change stocks (e.g., points per turn, cards drawn, territory gained)
  - **Converters**: Elements that affect flow rates (e.g., multipliers, efficiency bonuses)
  - **Deciders**: Information or conditions that control when flows activate (e.g., rules, triggers, player choices)

### Physical Deliverables
- **Game Prototype**: Physical, playable version using available materials
- **Complete Ruleset**: Clear, comprehensive rules that enable independent play
- **Systems Diagram**: Either causal loop diagram (with S/O notation and labeled feedback loops) or stock and flow diagram (with stocks, flows, converters, and deciders)

## Grading Criteria (14 Points Total)

**Systems Analysis & Diagram (5 points)**
- 5: Sophisticated systems diagram (causal loop OR stock/flow) with correct notation, clearly identified elements, and insightful analysis of system dynamics
- 4: Good systems diagram with mostly correct notation and identified key elements
- 3: Basic systems diagram with some correct notation and at least one clear relationship
- 2: Attempted systems diagram but missing key elements or incorrect notation
- 1: Minimal systems thinking with unclear or incorrect diagram structure
- 0: No systems analysis provided

**Game Functionality & Design (5 points)**  
- 5: Game functions excellently within constraints with clear design goals achieved
- 4: Game works well with minor issues, mostly achieves design goals
- 3: Game is functional and meets basic requirements
- 2: Game works but has functionality issues or unclear goals
- 1: Game has significant problems but demonstrates effort
- 0: Game is non-functional or incomplete

**Rule Clarity & Completeness (4 points)**
- 4: Rules are clear, complete, and enable independent play by others
- 3: Rules are mostly clear with minor gaps or confusion
- 2: Rules are present but have significant clarity issues
- 1: Rules have major problems but show basic understanding
- 0: Rules are incomplete or very unclear

## Systems Diagram Requirements
Choose the appropriate analysis method for your game:

**Causal Loop Analysis**:
- **Variable Selection**: Identify 4-6 key variables that change during gameplay
- **Causal Relationships**: Connect variables with arrows labeled S or O
- **Loop Labeling**: Clearly mark each feedback loop as R (Reinforcing) or B (Balancing)
- **System Behavior**: Brief explanation of how each loop affects gameplay dynamics

**Stock and Flow Analysis**:
- **Stock Identification**: Identify 3-5 key accumulations in your game
- **Flow Mapping**: Show what increases/decreases each stock and at what rates
- **Converter Analysis**: Identify elements that modify flow rates
- **Decider Documentation**: Show what triggers or controls flows
- **System Behavior**: Brief explanation of how stocks and flows create gameplay dynamics

**For Both Methods**:
- **Design Intention**: How does your system create the player experience you intended?

## Theoretical Framework Focus
- **Salen & Zimmerman Systems Theory**: Apply systems thinking from your assigned reading
- **Meaningful Choice**: How does your system create interesting player decisions?
- **Emergent vs. Embedded Narrative**: What stories emerge from your system vs. what you designed?
- **System Balance**: How do feedback loops maintain engaging play?

## Example Systems Elements to Consider
- **Resource Management**: Limited components creating scarcity decisions
- **Information Systems**: Hidden/revealed information affecting player choices
- **Interaction Systems**: How players affect each other's game states
- **Random Systems**: Chance elements and their impact on deterministic choices
- **Timing Systems**: Turn order, simultaneous play, or real-time elements

## Submission Requirements
- Physical game prototype brought to class for playtest session
- Complete ruleset (digital document)
- Systems diagram (causal loop OR stock/flow) with appropriate notation (visual/digital)
- In-class presentation of game and systems analysis

## Tips for Success
- **Start with the System**: Think about what kind of player behavior you want to encourage, then design systems that reward that behavior
- **Test Early and Often**: Playtest with others and observe how your system actually functions vs. your intentions
- **Embrace Simplicity**: Complex systems can emerge from simple rules
- **Document as You Design**: Keep track of how your system changes through iteration
- **Focus on Feedback**: How do players know they're making meaningful choices?

## Class Playtest Session Format
- Brief (2-minute) explanation of your game's system design goals
- Guided playtest with classmates (12-15 minutes)
- Group discussion of how the system functioned in practice
- Reflection on systems analysis accuracy

*This assignment establishes systems thinking as the foundation for all subsequent game design work, providing the conceptual framework for understanding games as designed experiences rather than arbitrary collections of rules.*
