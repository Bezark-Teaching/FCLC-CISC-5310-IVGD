# Tabletop Game Project
**Theory Lens**: Game Design as Systems Design  
**Assigned**: Week 1 (9/2) | **Due**: Week 2 (9/9)  
**Points**: 14

## Overview
Design and create a tabletop game that demonstrates explicit systems thinking. This analog project establishes the foundation for understanding games as complex adaptive systems before transitioning to digital development.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply systems thinking to game design fundamentals
- Create explicit system diagrams showing inputs, processes, outputs, and feedback loops
- Understand how game mechanics create player dynamics and aesthetic experiences
- Practice iterative design through playtesting and systems analysis

## Requirements

### Game Specifications
- **Classroom Playable**: Must work within classroom space and time constraints
- **15-minute Duration**: Complete play experience within time limit
- **2-4 Players**: Designed for small group classroom play
- **Clear Victory Condition**: Explicit win/lose states with defined objectives

### Systems Analysis Requirements (Graduate Level)
- **Explicit System Diagram**: Visual representation showing:
  - **Inputs**: Player actions, random elements, resource inputs
  - **Processes**: Game mechanics, rule interactions, state changes  
  - **Outputs**: Results, feedback, game state updates
  - **Feedback Loops**: How outputs influence future inputs
- **Systems Documentation**: Written analysis connecting diagram to play experience

### Physical Deliverables
- **Game Prototype**: Physical, playable version using available materials
- **Complete Ruleset**: Clear, comprehensive rules that enable independent play
- **Systems Analysis Document**: Diagram and written explanation of your game as a system

## Grading Criteria (14 Points Total)

**Systems Analysis & Documentation (6 points)**
- 6: Sophisticated systems diagram with clear identification of inputs, processes, outputs, and feedback loops, plus thoughtful written analysis
- 5: Good systems diagram with most elements identified and adequate analysis
- 4: Basic systems diagram with some elements identified
- 3: Attempted systems diagram but missing key elements or unclear
- 2: Minimal systems thinking demonstrated
- 0: No systems analysis provided

**Game Functionality & Design (5 points)**  
- 5: Game functions excellently within constraints with clear design goals achieved
- 4: Game works well with minor issues, mostly achieves design goals
- 3: Game is functional and meets basic requirements
- 2: Game works but has functionality issues or unclear goals
- 1: Game has significant problems but demonstrates effort
- 0: Game is non-functional or incomplete

**Rule Clarity & Completeness (3 points)**
- 3: Rules are clear, complete, and enable independent play by others
- 2: Rules are mostly clear with minor gaps or confusion
- 1: Rules are present but have significant clarity issues
- 0: Rules are incomplete or very unclear

## Systems Analysis Requirements
**Systems Documentation** (500-750 words):
- **System Diagram**: Visual representation with labeled components
- **Input Analysis**: What actions/elements enter your system?
- **Process Description**: How does your game transform inputs into outputs?
- **Output Identification**: What results does your system produce?
- **Feedback Loop Analysis**: How do outputs influence future system states?
- **Player Experience Connection**: How does your system create the intended play experience?

## Theoretical Framework Focus
- **Salen & Zimmerman Systems Theory**: Apply systems thinking from your assigned reading
- **Meaningful Choice**: How does your system create interesting player decisions?
- **Emergent vs. Embedded Narrative**: What stories emerge from your system vs. what you designed?
- **System Balance**: How do feedback loops maintain engaging play?

## Example Systems Elements to Consider
- **Resource Management**: Limited components creating scarcity decisions
- **Information Systems**: Hidden/revealed information affecting player choices
- **Interaction Systems**: How players affect each other's game states
- **Random Systems**: Chance elements and their impact on deterministic choices
- **Timing Systems**: Turn order, simultaneous play, or real-time elements

## Submission Requirements
- Physical game prototype brought to class for playtest session
- Complete ruleset (digital document)
- Systems analysis document with diagram
- In-class presentation of game and systems analysis

## Tips for Success
- **Start with the System**: Think about what kind of player behavior you want to encourage, then design systems that reward that behavior
- **Test Early and Often**: Playtest with others and observe how your system actually functions vs. your intentions
- **Embrace Simplicity**: Complex systems can emerge from simple rules
- **Document as You Design**: Keep track of how your system changes through iteration
- **Focus on Feedback**: How do players know they're making meaningful choices?

## Class Playtest Session Format
- Brief (2-minute) explanation of your game's system design goals
- Guided playtest with classmates (12-15 minutes)
- Group discussion of how the system functioned in practice
- Reflection on systems analysis accuracy

*This assignment establishes systems thinking as the foundation for all subsequent game design work, providing the conceptual framework for understanding games as designed experiences rather than arbitrary collections of rules.*
