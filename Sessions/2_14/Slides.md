#### Review
- Questions:
  - having nodes follow at different speeds
  - animations for node movement
  - scene transitions in-game- Signals and Referencing nodes
  - How can I make the character jump (vertically)?
  - How can I add collisions so the character doesn’t move off-screen?

# Game Design Card Combo Exercise (30 minutes)

## Materials Needed
- Index cards in three different colors (or regular cards + colored markers)
- Timer
- Whiteboard

---
## Phase 1: Card Creation (8 minutes)
Each student creates three cards, one for each category:

**BLUE CARDS: Core Mechanics**
- Write one interesting game mechanic you'd like to explore
- Examples: "Wall jumping", "Shrinking/growing", "Time rewinding", "Building bridges", "Swinging physics"

**RED CARDS: Themes/Feelings**
- Write one theme or emotion you want your game to convey
- Examples: "Loneliness", "Wonder", "Nostalgia", "Growing up", "Environmental care"

**YELLOW CARDS: Worlds/Settings**
- Write one specific place, time, or situation where your game takes place
- Examples: "Abandoned space station", "Inside a storm cloud", "Microscopic world", "Ancient library", "Child's bedroom"

---
## Phase 2: The Draft (12 minutes)
1. Collect and shuffle each category of cards separately
2. Each student draws one card from each pile
3. For the next 8 minutes:
   - Students can trade any card one-for-one with other students
   - Students can return any card and draw a new one (once per category)
   - Everyone must end with exactly three cards (one of each color)

---
## Phase 3: Concept Generation (10 minutes)
1. Students write down a game concept using at least two of their final cards
2. On their concept, they note:
   - Whether it's 2D or 3D
   - Solo project or looking for collaborators
   - Approximate scope (small/medium/large)
3. Students post concepts on the board and briefly share them
4. Students place a star next to concepts they'd be interested in joining

---
## Example Combinations
- Mechanic: "Gravity switching" + Setting: "Ancient library" + Theme: "Wonder"
  → A game where you solve physics puzzles in a magical library where each book contains its own gravitational field
- Mechanic: "Swinging physics" + Setting: "Inside a storm cloud" + Theme: "Environmental care"
  → A game where you're a rain drop using lightning bolts as swing points to help form beneficial rain patterns
- Mechanic: "Building bridges" + Setting: "Child's bedroom" + Theme: "Growing up"
  → A game where you help toys connect different parts of a room while dealing with changes as the child grows older

## Tips
- The cards are prompts, not restrictions - they're starting points for ideas
- It's okay to modify or combine elements from different cards
- Think about how your current skills could apply to new concepts
- Consider how the setting could enhance both the mechanics and the theme
